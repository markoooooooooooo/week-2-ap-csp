# open up the vscode from previous day
# create a new file called: week11_day1.py

# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Marvin"
age = 30
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_number = 7

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print("Marko".upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len("Marko"))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
fav_color = "black"
name = "Marko"
print(f" My name is", name,"and my favorite color is", fav_color)
#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
fav_number = 10
num1 = 6
num2 = 4
print(num1 + num2)

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
question = input("what is your favorite season?")
question2 = input("what is your favorite song?")

print (question + question2)

num3 = int(input("number 3 please"))
num4 = int(input("number 4 please"))
print(num3 + num4)


# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
